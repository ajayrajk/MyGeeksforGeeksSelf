/*
*
* Given a set represented as a string, write a recursive code to print all the subsets of it.
* The subsets can be printed in any order.
Examples:
Input :  set = "abc"
Output : "". "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"
Input : set = "abcd"
Output : "" "a" "ab" "abc" "abcd" "abd" "ac" "acd"
         "ad" "b" "bc" "bcd" "bd" "c" "cd" "d"

The idea is to consider two cases for every character.
* (i) Consider current character as part of the current subset (ii) Do not consider current
* character as part of the current subset.
Output:
abc
ab
ac
a
bc
b
c
Let us understand the recursion with an example "abc".
Every node in the below tree represents the string curr.
At root, index = 0.
At next level of tree index = 1
At third level, index = 2
At fourth level index = 3 (becomes equal to string length), so we print the subset.
